                <p>Dill has had to wrestle with vipers his whole life—at home, as the only son of a Pentecostal minister who
                urges him to handle poisonous rattlesnakes, and at school, where he faces down bullies who target him
                for his father’s extreme faith and very public fall from grace.<br /><br />

                The only antidote to all this venom is his friendship with fellow outcasts Travis and Lydia. But as they
                are starting their senior year, Dill feels the coils of his future tightening around him. The end of
                high school will lead to new beginnings for Lydia, whose edgy fashion blog is her ticket out of their
                rural Tennessee town. And Travis is happy wherever he is thanks to his obsession with the epic book
                series Bloodfall and the fangirl who may be turning his harsh reality into real-life fantasy. Dill’s
                only escapes are his music and his secret feelings for Lydia—neither of which he is brave enough to
                share. Graduation feels more like an ending to Dill than a beginning. But even before then, he must cope
                with another ending—one that will rock his life to the core.<br /><br />

                Debut novelist Jeff Zentner provides an unblinking and at times comic view of the hard realities of
                growing up in the Bible Belt, and an intimate look at the struggles to find one’s true self in the
                wreckage of the past.</p>
